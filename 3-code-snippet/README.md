```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
	for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
		go func() {
			for f := range cnp {
				f()
			}
		}()
	}
	cnp <- func() {
		fmt.Println("HERE1")
	}
	fmt.Println("Hello")
}
```
# Explainition

## 1. Working of the highlighted constructs
```
cnp := make(chan func(), 10)
```
Creates a buffered channel named `cnp` of type `func()` (i.e., no params, no return values). Buffer length is 10 so we can send up to 10 functions before we would have to wait.

```
for i := 0; i < 4; i++ {
	go func() {
		for f := range cnp {
			f()
		}
	}()
}
```

Fires up 4 goroutines, each continuously reads functions from the `cnp` channel and executes them immediately inside the `for f := range cnp` loop.

```
cnp <- func() {
	fmt.Println("HERE1")
}
```
Sends a function into the channel `cnp`, that will just print "HERE1" when executed.

## 2. Use-cases of these constructs
These constructs are commonly used in:

* Worker Pool Patterns: A set of goroutines (workers) consume jobs (functions) from a shared channel.

* Task Scheduling / Background Execution: Dynamically queue and fetch any message or execute some logic.

* Parallel processing: Split work across multiple goroutines to run concurrently.

## 3. Significance of the for loop with 4 iterations
```
for i := 0; i < 4; i++ { ... }
```
* Starts 4 worker goroutines to allow up to 4 tasks to be processed concurrently. 

* Improves throughput in workloads where multiple tasks can be executed independently. 

* Can help to utilize multi-core CPUs effectively.

## 4. Significance of make(chan func(), 10)
This is a buffered channel that acts as a task queue.

* Can hold 10 function tasks at once without blocking.

* Decouples the task producer (main goroutine) from the task consumers (worker goroutines).

* Helps in throttling or batching work if the producer is faster than consumers.


## 5. Why is “HERE1” not getting printed?
Even though the task is sent into the channel, "HERE1" does not get printed because:

* The main function finishes after printing "Hello" and Go programs finish when the main function completes. Even though we've fired up worker goroutines in the background, the main goroutine doesn't automatically wait for them to finish their work..

* To make "HERE1" print, we need to explicitly tell the main function to wait for the workers to do their job. The simplest way to do this would be to add a short `time.Sleep()` to make the main goroutine wait for some time before finishing and giving a chance to the worker goroutines to run.
